        <h1>Symptoms and the Causes</h1>
        Normally the first we know about a health problem is the SYMPTOM. <br />
        We get some pain, or "something is not right" and now we need to ACT!<br />
        so what do we do? We treat the symptom. That is fine in itself - but it
        is not enough, because we need to find out the root cause. <br />
        We need an answer to the question: WHY did this happen?<br />
        Once we know the root cause - we can PREVENT this from happening again.
        If we don't find out the root cause - we have only solved it short term,
        and have not taken action to PREVENT it from happening again.<br />
        This is VERY IMPORTANT to understand because if we never fix the root
        cause, we will keep on getting the same health issue until eventually
        our "fixes" no longer work.
