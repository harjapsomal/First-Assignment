        <h1>Why is this happening?</h1>
        Our lifestyle is changing and effecting our bodies.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cars were a luxury in 1950, and now most families have several cars
            in the family. We used to walk and now we drive.
          </li>
          <li>At work we have lifts which most of us use instead of stairs.</li>
          <li>
            The Food we eat is no longer nutritious. We order from home delivery
            services It is fast food made with unhealthy ingredients.
          </li>
          <li>We are stressed out in our work environments.</li>
          <li>
            We get little natural exercise. Even TVs have remotes so we don't
            have to move from the couch.
          </li>
        </ul>

        If this was just a ONE-OFF - it would be okay Our bodies are very
        versatile and are created to cope with most of these issues. The body is
        a natural healing mechanism and it heals itself as long as it is given
        the raw mateials to do it's job (i.e. Live food, exercise, fresh air,
        quality water, quality sleep)

        <h2>However</h2>
        This is NOT a one-off. It has become our LIFESTYLE, and our bodies
        eventually give up because we are not supplying the material or
        environment that our bodies need to remain healthy. All of this has a
        great toll on our health.
        <br />The combination of all of these factors is devastating on the
        body. Just think about it:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Very little exercise.</li>
          <li>
            non-nutritious mass-produced and unhealthy food is our daily diet.
          </li>
          <li>Sugar intake has reached epidemic levels.</li>
        </ul>
        As a consequence of this, type 2 diabetes has become a common disease.
        Cancer has become an epidemic, affecting 50% of the population.
